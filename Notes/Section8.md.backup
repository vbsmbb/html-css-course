## How Media Queries Work

### How Media Queries Work with Max-Width
1. @media (max-width: 600px)
	* Is width <= 600px?
	* If yes, this section of code applies
	* At 601px, this code no longer applies
	* 600px is the max-width at which this section of code applies
2. @media (max-width: 1200px)
	* Is width <= 1200px?
	* This section of code applies when < 1200px
3. The global code outside any media query applies in all situations
4. Media queries override certain CSS code at given media specifications
5. At a viewport width of 400px, the code in both media queries and the global code applies
6. At a viewport width 0f 1000px, only the code in the <1200px media query and the global code applies


## How to Select Breakpoints
1. Breakpoints are the viewport width at which we want our design to change
2. Originally breakpoints were selected baced on popular devices like ipad and iphone
3. This is not a good idea:
	* When optimizing for one device we are ignoring all other users with different devices and making a worse experience for them
	* This strategy is a nightmare for code maintenance
	* As devices change or new devices are added you have to change your code
4. A much better strategy:
	* Set your breakpoints for screenwidth ranges
	* Group together ranges of viewport widths for groups of devices like phones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers
5. The PERFECT strategy is:
	* Set breakpoints where the design breaks down
	* Ignore device categories altogether and only set breakpoints where the design breaks down
	* Start at one screen size:
		+ Desktop (largest) or
		+ Mobile (smallest)
	* Start changing the screen width
		+ Decrease for desktops
		+ Increase for Mobile devices
	* As soon as the design no longer looks acceptable stop and create a breakpoint (media query)
	* Basically, put yoiur breakpoints at the places where the design begins to look weird or out of place and try to not consider devices at all
	
## Responding to Small Laptops
1. The most important meta element in your HTML code for responsive web design is the one that sets the content width to the device-width and the content initial-scale to 1.0 (100%)
	* This meta element is added to the HTML head section when the initial code is automatically generated by the VS CODE editor
	* If you do not use the VS CODE editor then make sure the meta element which sets the content to the device-width with a scale of 1.0 is added to u=your HTML head
2. Do NOT use pixels in Media Queries use REM
	* Pixels will not repond to Users default font size setting teh browser
	* Pixels will not repond to users ZOOM setting in the browser 
3. Media queries do not repond to the font size setting in the HTML element
	* Media queries REM is ALWAYS a reflection of the users default font size setting in the browser
	* In media queries, 1rem = 1em = 16px
	* Some browsers have a BUG when media queries use REM
	* Therefore, use EM in media queries instead of REM
	* EM is the current font-size in pixels
4. Continue to use REM in the CSS inside the media queries
	* The use of EM is only required in the calculation for the pixels for the media query itself
	* The CSS inside the media query continues to use REM like the non-media query CSS code
5. First breakpoint set at 1344px
	
## Responding to Landscape Tablets
1. Small changes can make big differences
2. Just changing the font size of the root element (HTML) from 10 px to 9px makes a huge difference
3. Small changes in spacing can make a huge difference in appearance
4. Second breakpoint set at 1200px

## Responding to Tablets
1. A media query should work over a range of 200px to 300px
2. Third breakpoint set to 944px
