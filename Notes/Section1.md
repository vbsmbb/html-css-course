1. Added the Prettier file extension on VS Code
2. Changed four settings:
   A. Default Formatter: Set it to Prettier
   B. Format on Save: Select teh check box
   C. Auto save: onFocusChange (selection)
   D. Tab size: 2 (spaces)
3. I set up the One Monokai theme as directed. It can always be changed back if not my cup of tea.
4. By updating a file and moving out of the editor the file will be saved and formatted automatically.
